# Tribute-page-fcc
This is a tribute page on 'Ashoka - The Great' and my first freeCodeCamp project.
I am building this page using simple **HTML, CSS** and **Bootstrap.** <br>

**User stories:**
1. I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
2. I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
